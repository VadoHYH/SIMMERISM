      "en": "Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the bell peppers lengthwise, remove the seeds and stems. Lightly oil the bell peppers by tossing them in a bowl with some grapeseed oil or olive oil. Place the peppers on a baking sheet skin-side down. Roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes until the edges begin to show some color. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.\nStep 2: While the peppers are roasting, prepare your stuffing. Place the cream cheese, walnuts, garlic, salt, sriracha and black pepper in a bowl and mix until creamy (I used a fork to mash the ingredients together but Im sure this can be done in a food processor or mixer). Add the green onion and fold in to the cream cheese until combined. Test the cream cheese for flavor. If you would like, add more salt and/or sriracha.\nStep 3: Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Use a spoon (or a piping bag) to stuff the peppers liberally and place them back on the baking sheet. There is enough stuffing here to really pack those suckers up, so you dont need to worry about the amount of cream cheese youre portioning out. If the cream cheese is very soft, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow it to set up. If not, place pop the peppers in the oven and bake about 8 minutes. Change oven setting to high broil and bake an additional 2 minutes, until the tops of the cream cheese begin to brown (If theyre already brown at this point, skip the broiling).\nStep 4: Put on a pretty plate and serve to your friends.",

        "步驟2：辣椒正在烘烤時，準備餡料。將奶油奶酪，核桃，大蒜，鹽，sriracha和黑胡椒放在碗中，然後混合直至奶油（我用叉子將食材搗碎在一起，但我敢肯定可以在食品加工機或攪拌機中完成）。加入綠色洋蔥，然後將其折疊到奶油奶酪中，直至混合。測試奶油奶酪的味道。如果願意，請添加更多鹽和/或Sriracha。",

In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a small bowl, whisk together the red food coloring, cocoa, and vanilla. Add to the batter and beat well.\nStep 3: In a measuring cup, stir the salt into the buttermilk. Add to the batter in three parts alternating with the flour. With each addition, beat until the ingredients are incorporated, but do not overbeat. In a small bowl, stir together the cider vinegar and baking soda. Add to the batter and mix well. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the batter in the bowl, making sure the ingredients are well blended and the batter is smooth.\nStep 4: Divide the batter among the prepared pans. Arrange the oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and bake the cupcakes, switching positions of the pans halfway through baking, until a tester comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the pan 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool completely on a rack before icing. To ice, mound about cup of frosting on top of each cupcake and use an icing spatula to make a swirl on top. If desired, decorate with colored sprinkles.\nStep 5: Frosting\nStep 6: Combine butter, salt, and cream cheese in mixer and beat on medium speed 2-3 minutes.\nStep 7: Add sugar until just incorporated.

      "en": "Step 1: Set two racks in the middle of the oven. Preheat to 375F.\nStep 2: In a food processor, or bowl of an electric mixer, thoroughly mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and powder, salt, and sugar. While pulsing, or on low speed, add the butter, and then the egg. Continue processing or mixing until dough comes together in a mass.\nStep 3: Take rounded teaspoons of batter and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet approximately two inches apart. (I started off with loonie sized chunks of dough which was too big. Its more like the size of a quarter. Remember, youre aiming for 50 to 60 of these individual wafers!) With moistened hands, slightly flatten the dough. Bake for 9 minutes, rotating once for even baking. Set baking sheets on a rack to cool.\nStep 4: To make the cream, place butter and shortening in a mixing bowl, and at low speed, gradually beat in the sugar and vanilla. Turn the mixer on high and beat for 2 to 3 minutes until filling is light and fluffy.\nStep 5: To assemble the cookies, in a pastry bag with a 1/2 inch, round tip, pipe teaspoon-size blobs of cream into the center of one cookie. Place another cookie, equal in size to the first, on top of the cream. Lightly press, to work the filling evenly to the outsides of the cookie. (I dont think its entirely necessary to use a pastry bag. You could just spoon some icing on and squeeze between two wafers.) Continue this process until all the cookies have been sandwiched with cream.",

        "步驟3：拿起圓形的麵糊茶匙，然後放在羊皮紙襯裡的烤盤上，相距約兩英寸。 （我從Loonie大小的麵團開始，這太大了。它更像是四分之一的大小。請記住，您的目標是將50至60個單獨的晶圓的瞄準！烘烤9分鐘，旋轉一次以進行烘烤。將烤盤放在架子上冷卻。",
        "步驟4：要製作奶油，將黃油放在攪拌碗中，並以低速逐漸攪拌，逐漸攪拌糖和香草。將攪拌機打開高，然後攪拌2至3分鐘，直到餡料輕巧蓬鬆。",
        "步驟5：將餅乾組裝在一個帶有1/2英寸的糕點袋中，圓形尖端，管道茶匙大小的奶油液體進入一個餅乾的中心。將另一個餅乾尺寸與第一個相等的餅乾放在奶油頂部。輕輕按下，將填充物均勻地填充到餅乾的外部。 （我認為使用糕點袋不是完全必要的。您可以在兩個晶圓之間倒入一些糖霜並擠壓。）繼續此過程，直到所有餅乾都夾在奶油中為止。"

        "Step 1: Pears:",
        "Step 2: Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Peel, core and quarter the pears. Melt the butter in a large casserole or baking dish (I used a 10 quart Le Creuset Dutch Oven), add the pears and cook over high heat for about ten minutes or until the pears are golden brown. Keep stirring them so they are evenly colored. Transfer the baking dish/casserole into the oven for 7-10 minutes until the pears are easily pierced with a paring knife. Remove the pears from the oven, transfer to a bowl, and let them cool to room temperature.",
        "Step 3: Blackberry Sauce:",
        "Step 4: Wash and dry the blackberries. (I use a salad spinner). Reserve cup of the berries for garnish. Put the 3 cups of blackberries, the powered sugar and the lemon juice in a food processor and pure. Pour the pure into a bowl and set aside.",
        "Step 5: Pre-heat oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit. Take a full size sheet pan and line it with a silpat mat. (If you dont have one, use parchment paper sprayed with Pam cooking spray) Get a large pastry bag with a star tip ready. Put the granulated sugar in a food processor and blitz into a very fine powder, about a minute. Transfer the superfine sugar to a bowl. Add the confectioners sugar and the chocolate to the food processor and process until the chocolate is pulverized into tiny flecks. Transfer to a bowl. Pour the egg whites into a mixing bowl and beat at slow speed with a whisk attachment until the egg whites begin to froth, then add the cream of tartar. Increase the speed to high and beat the whites until they form stiff peaks. Add the superfine sugar and continue to beat for another two minute",
        "Step 6: Using a spatula, fill the pastry bag with the egg white mixture and pipe out the meringue kisses onto the lined baking sheet. As you finish squeezing out a dollop of egg white, gently push the star tip of the pastry bag into the dollop about inch and then quickly pull it away: that action gives the top a small point.",
        "Step 7: When all the meringues are piped out, place the baking sheet in the oven for an hour-and-a half. Youre not baking the meringues, but simply drying out the egg whites. Theyre done when the meringue is hard to the touch. Remove the meringues from the oven and let cool to room temperature.",
        "Step 8: To plate and serve, spoon several tablespoons of blackberry sauce into the center of a bowl, add 3 0r 4 pear quarters, several meringue kisses, and garnish with a few whole blackberries."

        "Step 5: Add a generous tablespoon of good olive oil and keep the heat at medium high. Unwrap the garlic and shallot and smash them using the flat side of your knife. They should be very soft. Add them to the skillet and cook for about 1 minute.",
        "Step 6: Add the mustard and cream to the skillet and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium low and add the brussels sprouts and beans (as many as you want to use). Toss everything together to coat, then season to taste with a generous amount of salt and black pepper.",

So if you intend to bake regularly, please invest in an oven thermometer so that you know the exact temperature your oven heats up to.",
